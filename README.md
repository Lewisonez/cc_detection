# SCAC: A Semi-Supervised Learning Approach for Cervical Abnormal Cell Detection 

To facilitate research in semi-supervised learning and cervical abnormal cell detection，we create an largely unlabeled cervical cytology dataset：

Our dataset includes 2471 WSI（Whole Slide Images）. These WSI were obtained using two different slide scanning devices, with 1204 from scanner 1 and 1267 from scanner 2.
By processing these WSI，hundreds of thousands of images can be obtained.
